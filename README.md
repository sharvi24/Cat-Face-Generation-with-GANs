# Cat-Face-Generation-with-GANs

I have trained 2 models: the original GAN and LSGAN on a cat dataset and learnt to generate cat face images with generator and discriminator network architectures roughly based on DCGAN. I have also implemented data augmentation via PyTorch's built-in transforms and spectral normalization of discriminator weights to improve the quality of generator images.
